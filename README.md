# CPP-Mini-Projects

- This repository is made with intention to help getting more familiar with c++.
- Questions are either collected from Doctors sheets, old exams or online website so feel free to contact me if there is any errors.
- This reprository is not monitored by anyone except me so it's not an offical source from the doctor.
