Write a C++ program that prompts the user to input the prices of three items: item1, item2,
and item3. The program should then asks whether the user is a student. If the user is a
student, a 20% discount is applied if the total price exceeds 1000 LE, or a 50% discount if
the total price exceeds 3000 LE. However, if the user is not a student, a 5% tax is applied to
the total price. Print the final amount of money the user should pay.
You must use both the Switch statement and the If statement in your solution.
