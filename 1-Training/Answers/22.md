## 22 - Pi finder
### An approximate value of π can be calculated using the series given below:
##### π = 4 (1-1/3+1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 + ... + (-1)^n/(2n+1)). 
### Write a program to calculate the approximate value of using this series. The program takes an input n that determines the number of terms in the approximation of the value of π and outputs the approximation. Include a loop that allows the user to repeat this calculation for new values n until the user says she or he wants to end the program.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int n;
    char choice;
    do
    {
        cout << "Enter n" << endl;
        cin >> n;
        double pi = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            pi += pow(-1, i) / (2 * i + 1);
        }
        pi *= 4;
        cout << "Approximate value of pi: " << pi << endl;
        cout << "Do you want to continue ?" << endl;
        cout << "Enter y for yes and n for no" << endl;
        cin >> choice;
    } while (choice == 'y' || choice == 'Y');
    // system("pause");
    return 0;
}
