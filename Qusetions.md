#1- Return Negative.

- Ask the user to enter a positive integer and the system prints the negative value of the same integer.

##Input:

5

##Output:

Negative value of 5 is -5


#2- Shapes Area Calculator 
Ask the user to choose between three different shapes (Rectangle - Circle - Triangle ) and based on his choice ask for the data needed to calculate the area of the shape he chooses.

#3- average of 3 numbers
ask the user to input 3 integers and calculate the average of the three numbers.
The average is the sum of the numbers divided by their count.

Input
2
4
6
Output
the average of the three numbers is equal to 4










#4- triangles
Write a program to check whether a triangle is Equilateral ( all sides are equal ) , isosceles ( only two sides are equal ) or scalene ( no sides are equal ).

Sample output 
Input three sides of triangle: 
50
50
60
This is an isosceles triangle.

 
#5- Max and Min 
Write a C++ program that requests four integer values from the user. It then prints the
maximum and minimum values entered. If the user enters the values 3, 2,5, and 0, the
program would indicate that 5 is the maximum and 0 is the minimum.
#6- Seconds to (hh:mm:ss)
Write a C++ program that reads a large number of seconds, then convert this number into time format (hh:mm:ss).i.e., (hours:minutes:seconds).
#7- Write a C++ program that requests an integer value from the user. If the value is between 1 and 100 inclusive, print "OK"; otherwise, print "Out of range".

#8- Write a C++ program that requests from the user a value representing the month, which is a number between 1 and 12. Then, the program prints the corresponding name of the month. For example, if the user enters 2 the program displays "February". If the number is less than 1 or greater than 12 the program displays an error message. ( write two answers one with if statements only and the other with switch statements only )

#9- Write a program to accept a coordinate point in an XY coordinate system and determine in which quadrant the coordinate point lies.

#10-Write a program to read any day number in integer and display the day name in word format.




#11- Consider the following section of C++ code:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int input;
    cin >> input;
    if (input < 10)
    {
        if (input != 5)
            cout << "wow ";
        else
            input++;
    }
    else
    {
        if (input == 17)
            input += 10;
        else
            cout << "whoa ";
    }
    cout << input << endl;
    return 0;
}


What will the program print if the user provides the following input?
(a) 3
(b) 21
(c) 5
(d) 17
(e) -5
#12- Why does the following section of code always print "ByeHi"?
int x;
cin >> x;
if (x < 0);
cout << "Bye";
cout << "Hi" << endl;


#13- simple calculator
Write and run a program that simulates a simple calculator. It reads two integers and a character.
If the character is a +, the sum is printed; if it is a -, the difference is printed; if it is a *, the product
is printed; if it is a /, the quotient is printed; and if it is a %, the remainder is printed. Use a switch
Statement.


#14- Rock Paper Scissors 
Write and run a program that plays the game of “Rock, Paper, Scissors”. In this game, two players
simultaneously say (or display a hand symbol representing) either “rock,” “paper,” or “scissors.”
The winner is the one whose choice dominates the other. The rules are: paper dominates (wraps)
rock, rock dominates (breaks) scissors, and scissors dominate (cut) paper. 

#15- Write and run a program that reads a six-digit integer and prints the sum of its six digits. Use the
quotient operator / and the remainder operator % to extract the digits from the integer. For example, if n is the integer 876,543, then n/1000%10 is its thousands digit 6.

#16- Write a C++ program to find the roots of a quadratic equation using the if else statement. There are three
cases based on the determinant (b^2 - 4ac).







#17- Using switch statement Write a C++ program to input marks of five subjects Physics, Chemistry,
Biology, Mathematics and Computer. Calculate percentage and grade according to following:
Percentage >= 90% : Grade A+
Percentage >= 85% : Grade A
Percentage >= 80% : Grade B+
Percentage >= 75% : Grade B
Percentage >= 70% : Grade C+
Percentage >= 65% : Grade C
Percentage >= 60% : Grade D
Percentage < 60% : Grade F
